 Use a switch statement to assign a final grade for your students.
 
 Write a switch statement that will print different statements based on what range `currentAverage` falls into. Below is a list of ranges and the associated grades
 
 - 90 - 100: "A"
 - 80 - 89:  "B"
 - 70 - 79:  "C"
 - 60 - 69:  "D"
 -    < 60:  "F"
 
 Try several currentAverage values to make sure your code works. (1 point)

case 90...100:
    print("A")
case 80...89:
    print("B")
case 70...79:
